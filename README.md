EnchantPlus
===============

EnchantPlus is a mech/tool plugin which expands the enchanting system on your Minecraft server!
This is the official repository of it and you are free to use snippets/classes of it or make a fork and modify it 
under the condition to give credit to me or if you're customizing the whole plugin not to remove my name from the authors in the plugin.yml! Pull requests are highly appreciated if they're well-made (that means I can understand what the actual improvement is and how it works) and will be accepted as soon as take a look at it and think it's a real improvement ;)
